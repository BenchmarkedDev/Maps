        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a level designer best known by the alias "Benchmarked". I am
          primarily known for my Bunny Hop maps, although I have made maps for a
          number of other gamemodes such as Prop Hunt, Murder, Surf, and
          Sandbox.<br /><br />Bunny Hop still remains the gamemode in which I
          have made my most contributions though, with over 60 maps currently
          published.

        <h2>What I do</h2>
        <p>
          I create maps for all source games, but mainly CSS. I aspire to make
          my maps beatable for inexperienced players, while also making them
          competitive for more advanced players to strive for better times.<br /><br />I
          enjoy the process of having an idea in your head, and slowly bringing
          it to life inside of Hammer. I don't map too often anymore, though.

        <h2>How it started</h2>
        <p>
          I always had an interest in level design, but never knew how to
          actually make a map. I was an Admin on a Garry's Mod Prop Hunt server,
          and was one day asked to go to the Bunny Hop server to moderate the
          players.<br /><br />I got into the gamemode and met a bunch of cool
          people, made my first (terrible) map, and that's really where my
          mapping journey began.
