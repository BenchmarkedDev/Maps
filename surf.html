          An extensive collaboration I hosted with a bunch of my friends. Six
          stages getting progressively harder, and six unique bonuses. <br />
          <br />
          This map is ideal for players of all skill levels due to the
          progressing difficulty. It's a good map to test your ability in,
          similar to surf_666.
          <br /><br />
          The bonuses are incredibly varied, from easy surf to tier 7 surf, bhop
          bonuses, and even KZ. <br /><br />

          A design carried over from bhop_enlightened and bhop_enlightened2.
          This was my second map to ever make it onto the KSF servers. It's
          about a minute long tier 1 linear map, designed with smooth surfing
          and simple but effective aesthetics in mind.
          <br /><br />
          The map also features multiple bonuses. Some made by myself, and
          others made by my friends. Once again, a lot of variety in these
          bonuses, and I think there is something for everyone here.<br /><br />

        <h2>Released 20/05/20</h2>
        <p>
          My first surf map to ever make it to KSF! A super colorful and unique
          tier 2 map with 5 stages and 3 bonuses.<br /><br />
          Features varied gameplay, visually pleasing design, immersive
          ambience, and a route that both newbies and veterans alike can have
          fun with.<br /><br />
          I should also mention that B3 is notorious for being one of the harder
          bonuses in Surf. You can thank ArcticPanda for that one.<br /><br />
