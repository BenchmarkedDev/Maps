          My most recent map and the first map that I've released for years.
          With gameplay designed to be friendly to beginners, while still having
          competitive routes for advanced players, this map offers enjoyment to
          players of all skill levels.<br /><br />
          Adding on high attention to detail with the design of each and every
          room, hidden lore behind the origin of the map, and eerie ambience -
          this map is by far my best yet in terms of visuals.<br /><br />

          A map that combines various segments of dozens of some of my most
          well-known maps, and by far my longest linear map so far.<br /><br />
          This map stands out due to its incredibly varied gameplay and visuals.
          It's easy to beat, but extremely hard to get a good no-fail run. This
          was also the final map I released before I stopped mapping for years.

          A shorter map (roughly slightly under a minute) with a lovely color

          A 1-1:30m map I made and uploaded on a smurf account. I put very
          little effort into this map, but despite that it was surprisingly well

          A series of five short strafe maps I made that was uploaded onto a
          smurf account on Gamebanana. Each map is between 20-40 seconds, and
          there is also a longer map which joins up all 5 maps into one, so
          these maps total six individual creations. Not as much effort as I
          would usually put in, but appreciated by the respectable strafe
          community nonetheless. <br /><br />

          This map proves that It's perfectly possible to make a stunning map
          with just dev textures. Yellow and blue have awesome contrast in this
          map, and the entire map is contained within a small area which you
          have to slowly navigate your way around.<br /><br />
          Around a minute and a half in length, an extremely difficult map to
          get a good run on.

          A fast map made even faster. Roughly 1:20 in length. While the
          gameplay is rather straightforward and simplistic in most areas of the
          map, trying to maintain speed while going through the stages is a real
          challenge. Also has a really long bonus made by Nallieheai. <br />

          The very first iteration of Enlightenment. Several stages with
          progressive difficulty. This was my first "staged" bhop map, and one
          that really allowed me to come up with a bunch of creative ideas for
          each stage.

          While it's not for everyone, this map has been ran competitively
          multiple times and I was really happy to release something very
