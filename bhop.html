          My most recent map and the first map that I've released for years.
          With gameplay designed to be friendly to beginners, while still having
          competitive routes for advanced players, this map offers enjoyment to
          players of all skill levels.<br /><br />
          Adding on high attention to detail with the design of each and every
          room, hidden lore behind the origin of the map, and eerie ambience -
          this map is by far my best yet in terms of visuals.<br /><br />

          A map that combines various segments of dozens of some of my most
          well-known maps, and by far my longest linear map so far.<br /><br />
          This map stands out due to its incredibly varied gameplay and visuals.
          It's easy to beat, but extremely hard to get a good no-fail run. This
          was also the final map I released before I stopped mapping for years.

          Beautiful collab map by Sonia and Myself. I created the gameplay, and
          she worked her magic with the design. The map is roughly 1:30 long and
          honestly my favourite bhop collab that I have participated in (not
          that I've participated in many..) Hope I get to work with Sonia again

          A series of five short strafe maps I made that was uploaded onto a
          smurf account on Gamebanana. Each map is between 20-40 seconds, and
          there is also a longer map which joins up all 5 maps into one, so
          these maps total six individual creations. Not as much effort as I
          would usually put in, but appreciated by the respectable strafe
          community nonetheless. <br /><br />

          This map proves that It's perfectly possible to make a stunning map
          with just dev textures. Yellow and blue have awesome contrast in this
          map, and the entire map is contained within a small area which you
          have to slowly navigate your way around.<br /><br />
          Around a minute and a half in length, an extremely difficult map to
          get a good run on.

          It simply wouldn't have been right for me to end my mapping career
          without creating a map inspired by the mapper that got me into mapping
          in the first place - Nyro (creator of surf_lt_omnific)
          <br /><br />
          While nowhere near Omnific level, this is a map I put a lot of love
          into and I think It's at least semi-faithful to Omnific. I had a lot
          of fun making it and coming up with ideas for each stage. <br /><br />

          This map is an extremely short (20 sec or less) strafe map, but I just
          had to make a map that was themed around one of my favourite childhood
          games of all time. The nostalgia I get just from looking at the
          thumbnail of this map is overwhelming.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

          Ah yes, that one bhop map I made that is basically a surf map. Named
          after some silly Swedish friend I had, this map is what we would call
          a 'fly' map, and a map that I personally love. Though it's certainly
          not for everyone.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

          Another map made for Asko? What a lucky man. Unlike the original Asko,
          this is a lot more complex and technical. Still relatively short at
          under a minute long, the map requires some serious precision to pull
          off a solid run. The design is also one I remember being really happy
          with, it looks awesome.

          where the hell I got the idea to make a map themed around the color of
          bubblegum, but hey, some people like playing it despite the fact I
          didn't invest much time into creating it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

        <h2>Released 20/01/19</h2>
        <p>
          A very long and challenging map to one-shot. This map combines
          Orbital, Celestial, and Dimensional into one linear map. Not a bad map
          to play if you want to challenge yourself to hit something on the
          longer side.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

          A combination of bhop, surf, and boosts! A fun linear one-shot map
          that offers a good challenge while not being too difficult. Also, best
          skybox ever. Just saying.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

          Fun fact: This is my least favourite map I've ever made. Why? Well, it
          starts off quite fun and promising, but as it goes on the gameplay
          quickly becomes repetitive and lazy. I should've just released the map
          once I got bored of it, rather than filling in the blanks with boring
          gameplay.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

          A fun, open-skybox map themed around the Rainbow Road map from Mario
          Kart. I might remake this one day, as I don't feel like my mapping
          ability at the time was up to the standard needed to do Rainbow Road

          Yay, another space-themed map. A bit longer than Celestial and less
          technical than Orbital, this map was another one I made in my phase of
          'try to make as many maps as humanly possible'<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

          My first ever "asian-themed" map. To which I would go on to reuse

          by the community and I still see people playing them even years after
          they were released.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
