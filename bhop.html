          My most recent map and the first map that I've released for years.
          With gameplay designed to be friendly to beginners, while still having
          competitive routes for advanced players, this map offers enjoyment to
          players of all skill levels.<br /><br />
          Adding on high attention to detail with the design of each and every
          room, hidden lore behind the origin of the map, and eerie ambience -
          this map is by far my best yet in terms of visuals.<br /><br />

          A map that combines various segments of dozens of some of my most
          well-known maps, and by far my longest linear map so far.<br /><br />
          This map stands out due to its incredibly varied gameplay and visuals.
          It's easy to beat, but extremely hard to get a good no-fail run. This
          was also the final map I released before I stopped mapping for years.

          A shorter map (roughly slightly under a minute) with a lovely color
          scheme and stunning visuals. Hop through this pretty map and enjoy the
          mix of hot pink and cyan blue colors popping as you play.<br /><br />This
          was also the first map I made after returning from a pretty long
          mapping hiatus.<br />

          A 1-1:30m map I made and uploaded on a smurf account. I put very
          little effort into this map, but despite that it was surprisingly well
          recieved. Simple but effective design with enjoyable gameplay (for
          strafers, anyway...) <br /><br /><br /><br />

          A series of five short strafe maps I made that was uploaded onto a
          smurf account on Gamebanana. Each map is between 20-40 seconds, and
          there is also a longer map which joins up all 5 maps into one, so
          these maps total six individual creations. Not as much effort as I
          would usually put in, but appreciated by the respectable strafe
          community nonetheless. <br /><br />

          My longest staged map ever, and the sequel to the original
          Enlightened.<br /><br />
          Make your way through several unique and challenging levels, each one
          more difficult than the previous. Attempt to no-fail it if you really
          want a challenge. <br />
